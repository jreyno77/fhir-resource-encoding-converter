# fhir-resource-encoding-converter
This project was created in order to deal with converting xml resources to json, but made to deal with any encoding HAPI.io uses.

This is useful to anyone who does not have access to a fhir server that implements the $convert operation.

If $convert is available please consider using that instead, this is a work around.
